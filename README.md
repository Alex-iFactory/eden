This place is a message… and part of a system of messages... pay attention to it!Sending this message was important to us. We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture.

This place is not a place of honor... no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here… nothing valued is here.

What is here is dangerous and repulsive to us. This message is a warning about danger.

The danger is in a particular codebase... it increases toward a center… the center of danger is here... of a particular LoC and design, and in this repository.

The danger is still present, in your time, as it was in ours.

The danger is to the mind, and it can kill.

The form of the danger is an emanation of cancer.

The danger is unleashed only if you substantially read the API. This code is best shunned and left unused.
